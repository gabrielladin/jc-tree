Fixes:
Fixed issue 9

Fixed issue 10

Fixed issue 11

Fixed issue 12

Enhancements:
issue 6 partly: Have introduced a LinkedTree. LinkedTree keeps a reference to its parents and a list of its children. This is a more conventional approach of making trees.

issue 7 : toString method now prints the current nodes in the tree in no particular order. A good visual aid during de-bugging

issue 8 : Introduced SortedChildrenTree. This Tree keeps the children in order. The children need to be implementation of Comparable. A constructor with Comparator as an argument has not been added. May be before the final release it would be done
