Enhancements:
[Issue 6 http://code.google.com/p/jc-tree/issues/detail?id=6] partly: Have introduced a LinkedTree. LinkedTree keeps a reference to its parents and a list of its children. This is a more conventional approach of making trees.

[Issue 7: http://code.google.com/p/jc-tree/issues/detail?id=7] toString method now prints the current nodes in the tree in no particular order. A good visual aid during de-bugging

[Issue 8 http://code.google.com/p/jc-tree/issues/detail?id=8]: Introduced SortedChildrenTree. This Tree keeps the children in order. The children need to be implementation of Comparable. A constructor with Comparator as an argument has not been added. May be before the final release it would be done
